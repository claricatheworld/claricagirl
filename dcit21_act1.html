BY EMILY DICKINSON <br>
<br>
Because I could not stop for Death – <br>
He kindly stopped for me – <br>
The Carriage held but just Ourselves – <br>
And Immortality. <br>
<br>
We slowly drove – He knew no haste <br>
And I had put away <br>
My labor and my leisure too, <br>
For His Civility – <br>
<br> 
We passed the School, where Children strove <br>
At Recess – in the Ring – <br>
We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain – <br>
We passed the Setting Sun – <br>
<br>
Or rather – He passed Us – <br>
The Dews drew quivering and Chill – <br>
For only Gossamer, my Gown – <br>
My Tippet – only Tulle – <br>
<br>
We paused before a House that seemed <br>
A Swelling of the Ground – <br>
The Roof was scarcely visible – <br>
The Cornice – in the Ground – <br>
<br>
Since then – 'tis Centuries – and yet <br>
Feels shorter than the Day <br>
I first surmised the Horses' Heads <br>
Were toward Eternity – <br>
